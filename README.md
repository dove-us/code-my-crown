## Foreward

This is a repository to aide in the creation and celebration of Black hair textures and protective styles in video games.

Instructions, personal insights, and detailed references, created by people within the Black community, can be found on [this page](https://www.dove.com/us/en/stories/campaigns/code-my-crown.html) and in [this downloadble PDF guide](https://assets.unileversolutions.com/v1/117113827.pdf).

No single document can capture the history and beauty of Black hair textures and protective styles. But through this body of work, our goal is to help create the change we want to see.

## Introduction

New research shows 85% of Black gamers believe Black hair textures are poorly represented in video games. And approximately 8 in 10 Black gamers feel excluded, discriminated against, or not good enough when they don’t see themselves represented accurately[^1].

It’s not just the players who feel this way. Nearly 9 in 10 developers agree there should be more resources available to enable them to code Black hair textures that realistically represent real-world styles.[^1]

Created in partnership with Black artists, academics, and stylists, Code My Crown exists to make sure Black hair textures and protective styles are recreated digitally with the care and respect they deserve. This guide gives developers and designers the tools needed to better represent real beauty in the digital world.
